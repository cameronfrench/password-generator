# Password-Generator
## Description

In this project, I modified exisiting source code by adding a function to generate a random password based on a certain set of criteria that the user would input through series of prompts. When you click the generate button, the prompts will begin and the user can enter their inputs. The various questions will gather a character length of 8-128, and if they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and a special symbol. Once the user walks through these prompts, the password will appear in the box where the placeholder of "Your secure password" is.
